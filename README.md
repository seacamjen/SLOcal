#### By _**Cameron Jensen**_

## Description

_I have a family with young kids and it always seems difficult to find great activities to do with them. SLOcal family fun is an app designed for the area surrounding San Luis Obispo, CA. You can look up ideas of what to do, see, where to play. Locals will be able to post their favorite activities and a search used by yelp will also supplement another search. Now you can find all the best trails, museums, and parks to play in._
